# About

The objective of this model is to establish consistent standards for evaluating the environmental impact of AI. It is designed to serve as central entry point for stakeholders to approach the topic. The model, its instantiation/tailoring, and examples are to be subjected to continuous development and enhancement. It is therefore of great importance to the authors that stakeholders in the life cycle of AI-based systems report errors, issues, and missing items, so that they can be appended/fixed. Therefore, should you identify an error, a missing item, or any other contribution you wish to make to the collection, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/Green-AI-Model/Green-AI-Model.github.io/issues) or contact us.
