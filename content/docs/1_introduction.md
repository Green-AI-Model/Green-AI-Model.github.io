# Introduction
![](../figures/palceholder_ai.png)

The Green AI Reference Model presents a comprehensive framework that is intended to serve as a guide for stakeholders across the AI life cycle, with the objective of enhancing the sustainability of AI systems. This model is pivotal in advancing the dual objectives of Green AI: mitigating climate change and minimizing environmental impacts. The model achieves this through two principal approaches: "Green **by** AI" and "Green **in** AI."

"Green by AI" refers to leveraging AI technologies to foster environmental sustainability, such as the optimization of energy use or the enhancement of waste management. Conversely, "Green in AI" emphasizes the development and implementation of AI solutions that themselves consume fewer resources and generate less waste. The Green AI Reference Model, in particular, aims to significantly reduce carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions and conserve critical resources, including water, rare earth elements (REE), and others.

This model not only advocates for resource efficiency but also champions the adoption of practices that reduce the environmental footprint of AI operations. This guidance is intended to facilitate the transition of the AI community towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.

## Why does this model exist and why is it necessary?
There are numerous guidelines and methods for measureing and assessing the envidonmental impact of AI systems. However, these often rely on flawed assumptions or inaccurate data, which can lead to erroneous conclusions. The Green AI Reference Model addresses these issues. It provides a clear and comprehensive list of the factors that influence the sustainability of AI technologies, enabling stakeholders to make more informed and effective decisions. This model facilitates the establishment of consistent standards for evaluating the environmental impact of AI, ensuring that our efforts to make AI "greener" are based on sound scientific principles and are genuinely effective.

## How is this Model structured?
This introduction establishes the fundamental distinction between two principal approaches: “Green **by** AI” focuses on leveraging AI technologies to enhance environmental sustainability. In contrast, “Green **in** AI” centers on developing AI solutions that inherently consume fewer resources and generate less waste.

Following the introduction, the model details the methods for quantifying the environmental footprint of AI systems. It emphasizes the significance of precise measurements in order to comprehend and effectively address the ecological impact of AI technologies. The model covers a range of sources and factors that contribute to the environmental impact of AI technologies.

The central focus of this model is to examine the various factors that influence the sustainability of AI. These are organized into five primary categories: __Use Case__, __Model__, __Data__, __Hardware__, and __Tools__. In each category, specific components or practices within AI systems that significantly affect their environmental impact are examined. This includes the energy consumption of data centers, the carbon footprint of hardware production, and the ecological effects of electronic waste disposal.  

Furthermore, the model discusses the interplay and interrelationship between these influence factors. It highlights how these elements do not operate in isolation but interact in complex ways that can either amplify or mitigate their individual impacts. This section underscores the necessity of an integrated approach to optimizing ecological sustainability by aligning model complexity with use case requirements, optimizing data characteristics for efficient hardware usage, and selecting appropriate tools that enhance sustainability.

In the discussion section, the document would ideally explore the real-world applications and challenges of implementing the Green AI principles. It addresses potential barriers to adoption, such as technological limitations, economic constraints, and the need for industry-wide standardization to ensure broad implementation of sustainable practices in AI.

## How to apply this model?
This Reference Model can be applied in several ways. First, it can help improve both existing and new AI applications. It does this by providing a detailed overview of the factors that affect environmental impact and showing how to measure this impact. Second, the model serves as a guide for future research. It outlines the unresolved issues that need to be addressed to develop truly Green AI. Finally, it offers non-technical stakeholders, like policymakers and business leaders, a clear understanding of the current challenges. This helps them create informed policies and strategies that support sustainable AI development.
