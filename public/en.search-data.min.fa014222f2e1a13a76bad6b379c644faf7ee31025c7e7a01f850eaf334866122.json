Introduction","section":"Docs","content":" Introduction # The Green AI Reference Model presents a comprehensive framework aimed at guiding stakeholders across the AI lifecycle to enhance the sustainability of AI systems. This model is pivotal in advancing the dual objectives of Green AI: mitigating climate change and minimizing environmental impacts. It achieves this through two principal approaches: \u0026ldquo;Green by AI\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Green in AI.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Green by AI\u0026rdquo; refers to leveraging AI technologies to foster environmental sustainability, such as optimizing energy use or enhancing waste management. Conversely, \u0026ldquo;Green in AI\u0026rdquo; emphasizes developing and implementing AI solutions that inherently consume fewer resources and generate less waste. The latter is the primary focus of the Green AI Reference Model, which seeks to significantly lower CO2 (equivalent) emissions and conserve critical resources including water, rare minerals, and others.\nThis model not only advocates for resource efficiency but also champions the adoption of practices that reduce the environmental footprint of AI operations, thus steering the AI community towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future.\nWhy does this model exist/why is it necessary # There are many guidelines and ways to measure how environmentally friendly AI systems are, but they often rely on wrong assumptions or inaccurate data. This can lead to wrong conclusions. The Green AI Reference Model is important because it addresses these issues. It clearly lists out the factors that affect how sustainable AI technologies are, helping everyone involved make better, clearer decisions. This model helps set consistent standards to judge the environmental impact of AI, making sure our efforts to make AI greener are based on solid science and are truly effective.\nHow is this Model structured? # The model began with an introduction that sets the foundation by distinguishing two key approaches: “Green by AI” focuses on leveraging AI technologies to enhance environmental sustainability, while “Green in AI” centers on developing AI solutions that inherently consume fewer resources and generate less waste.\nFollowing the introduction, the model details the methods for quantifying the environmental footprint of AI systems. It emphasizes the importance of accurate measurements to understand and mitigate ecological impacts effectively, covering various sources and factors influencing the environmental impact of AI technologies.\nThe core of this model is dedicated to exploring the influence factors that affect AI sustainability. These are organized into five primary categories: Use Case, Model, Data, Hardware, and Tools. Each category scrutinizes specific components or practices within AI systems that significantly affect their environmental impact, from the energy consumption of data centers to the carbon footprint of hardware production and the ecological effects of electronic waste disposal.\nAdditionally, the document discusses the interplay between these influence factors. It highlights how these elements do not operate in isolation but interact in complex ways that can either amplify or mitigate their individual impacts. This section underscores the necessity of an integrated approach to optimizing ecological sustainability by aligning model complexity with use case requirements, optimizing data characteristics for efficient hardware usage, and selecting appropriate tools that enhance sustainability.\nIn the discussion section, the document would ideally explore the real-world applications and challenges of implementing the Green AI principles. It addresses potential barriers to adoption, such as technological limitations, economic constraints, and the need for industry-wide standardization to ensure broad implementation of sustainable practices in AI.\nHow to apply this model? # This Reference Model can be applied in several ways. First, it can help improve both existing and new AI applications. It does this by providing a detailed overview of the factors that affect environmental impact and showing how to measure this impact. Second, the model serves as a guide for future research. It outlines the unresolved issues that need to be addressed to develop truly Green AI. Finally, it offers non-technical stakeholders, like policymakers and business leaders, a clear understanding of the current challenges. This helps them create informed policies and strategies that support sustainable AI development.\n"},{"id":1,"href":"/docs/2_quantify/","title":"2. Quantifiying the Environmental Footprint","section":"Docs","content":" Quantifiying the Environmental Footprint # Why is it important to know the footprint # Understanding the ecological impact of AI systems is crucial for effective mitigation efforts. For instance, simply replacing old hardware with new, more energy-efficient models can ironically result in a larger overall CO2 footprint when considering the emissions associated with producing new hardware and disposing of the old. Thus, before making optimizations, it\u0026rsquo;s essential to fully understand the potential environmental benefits, which can only be achieved by comprehensively quantifying the entire footprint of the system.\nWhat are the environmental influences and sources for this? # Since AI-Systems are complex systems, so is their environmental influences. The complete footprint consist of multiple factors, first the execution on Hardware (energy consumption). Second the Infrastructure that is needed for this execution, e.g. the Data Center but also the Offices for workers. In infrastructure, emissions are mainly in the form of embodied emissions, but also water that is used to cool the servers and more. Last the Human that is tied to the development, marketing etc. of the AI-System. Life-Cycle-Assessment provides an effective framework for evaluating these emissions.\nBut how do we measure those impacts? # The tricky part comes, when you try to measure those emissions. Measuring the energy-consumption of AI-Systems can be done in several ways, with both benefits and downsides. The most accurate would be to measure the energy-consumption with a power-meter. But sometimes you do not have Access to the machine or a capable power meter. Then the energy-consumption could be estimated by softwaretools, such as RAPL or NVIDI-SMI, wich is more accessible and easier to use but not as accurate. Last, if you do not have Hardware that supports those Tools, you could estimate the energy-consumption by taking the time and utilisation of the system and combining it with the TDP of the system. Even this is impossible if you are on a public cloud and do not know the TDP of your system. Depending in the hardware used, there a other ressources that need to be measured. E.g. for Data Center with water-cooling, the water consumption plays an important role as well. No matter where the AI-System runs, it requires Hardware that comes with a CO2 footprint for its production and transport to the execution location. This is something that can\u0026rsquo;t be measured. There you have to relay on estimations, if any exist. But even after use, the hardware could produce significant environmental impacts, since it has to be disposed or in best case recycled or reused.\nHow do we report our results? # After measuring your System, you need to Report the numbers. Here it is very important to report the right number to the right audience. For example reporting the CO2 Footprint of a trained model to the public would be a good choice if other models to do the same. That way customers could choose the more environmently friendly model. But for a scientific audience this might be not enough. Maybe they want to compare your Architecture with theirs. Then they also need to know on what Hardware and how much energy it requires.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/3_influence_factors/","title":"3.
